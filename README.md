# Hotel Booking Analysis Dashboard Using Flask

## About the Data
The hotel booking demand dataset is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019. The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020.<br>
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.<br>

## Context Analysis

1. Knowing the distribution of the guest's origin country
2. Finding out when is the best time of year to book a hotel room (to get the best daily rate),
3. Estimating when booking times have many cancellations (so the losses arising from the cancellation can be overcome).
